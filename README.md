<h1>Project 1 - Aloha Apparel</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Using website designs provided by our instructors, we re-created an e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and jQuery scripts. The website was built using the mobile first approach, making it a responsive website. We added some special features, including a quantity badge that appeared by the shopping cart logo when a buy button is pressed, a product image scroller, a fixed navigation bar and smooth scrolling.</p>
