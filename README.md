<h1>Project 1 - Aloha Apparel</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Using website designs provided by our instructors, we re-created an e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and jQuery scripts. The website was built using the mobile first approach, making it a responsive website. We added some special features, including a quantity badge that appeared by the shopping cart logo when a buy button is pressed, a product image scroller, a fixed navigation bar and smooth scrolling.</p>

<h2>Languages and tools used:</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS (with CSS reset styles)</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>jQuery (bxSlider, smooth scrolling, fixed header, DOM navigation)</li>
<li>Flexbox</li>
<li>Mobile first approach to design & coding (Responsive Web Design)</li>
<li>Git</li>
</ul>

<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
<p>During this project, I honed my HTML and CSS skills while learning how to implement jQuery into a website. Flexbox was difficult to grasp at first but after learning how to use it, I love it compared to floats. It was also my first time using a jQuery plugin such as the bxSlider but I am confident I can edit and style jQuery plugins after this project.</p>
